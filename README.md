# quizzyinreact
A clone of [quizzyInTypeScript](https://github.com/BerkYeni/quizzyInTypeScript) that is entirely rewritten in React.js.

This project is part of a learning experiment about differences between two identical projects that are written in Vanilla TypeScript and React.js respectively.

The experiment compares the developer experience, user experience, development time, performance and other aspects of both projects.
